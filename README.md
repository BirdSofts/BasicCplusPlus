# Introduction 
CplusPlus project originally aimed to serve as a personal private reference for coding in C++ language.
The project is just learning materials, which tries very hard to bring learning instruction, the source code itself and the compilation results all together in coding environment in easy language which results in experiencing more joy while learning to code.


# Getting Started
1.  Installation process:
Both Visual Studio and Qt Creator (MinGW compiler under Windows) IDEs have been tested.

<td>git clone git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/BirdSofts/CplusPlus/CplusPlus</td>
</tr>
</table>

2.  Software dependencies:
Dependent on Windows APIs

3.  Latest releases:
Source code is released and ready to be built.

4.  API references
Windows's console: screen, colour and font manipulations APIs.

# Build and Test
If you are a beginner, use Visual Studio or know what you are doing.
